**This is a test for G.Network.**  
  
To see the project in action deploy to the development server using ```sls deploy``` command, then update the test.sh ```BASE_DOMAIN``` and run the ```test.sh```.
Please note that default serverless deployment is deploying to ```/dev``` style url as such all endpoints will be preceded with that.
